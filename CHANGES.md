# TweakScale :: Changes

* 2023-0716: 2.4.7.2 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.3
	+ A new Feature was introduced that automatically deactivates the **Auto Scale** and the **Chain Scale** features every time the user enters the Editor, creates a new Craft or loads one.
		- Aims to minimize support tickets opened by users that forget the features active and then thinks it's a bug on TweakScale
		- Default is On, can be turned off on the TweakScale Settings dialog.
