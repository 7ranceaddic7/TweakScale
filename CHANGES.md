# TweakScale :: Changes

* 2020-0718: 2.4.3.19 (Lisias) for 1.4.1 <= KSP <= 1.10.0
	+ **FINAL** release for the 2.4.3.x series.
		- Honest this time. I hope... :)
	+ KSP 1.10 is considered supported. No more Houstons on it.
		- But anything later will trigger a Houston again.
	+ Some new Parts are now scalable.
		- [Thanks](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/pull/122), [7ranceaddic7](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/pull/123)!
	+ [KSP-Recall](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/KSP-Recall/releases) is only pushed on KSP 1.9.x now.
	+ A somewhat stupid mistake on handling `GameEvents.onEditorShipModified` [was fixed](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/issues/119).
	+ A pretty stupid mistake on handling `OnDestroy` was fixed. Thanks again, [7ranceaddic7](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/issues/124)
	+ A [weird mistake](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/issues/125) on withdrawing "insane" parts were detected and fixed.
		- This time. (sigh) 
* 2020-0713: 2.4.3.18 (Lisias) for 1.4.1 <= KSP <= 1.10.0
	+ **Withdrawn**
		- I refuse to acknowledge the existence of this thing.
