# TweakScale :: Changes

* 2024-0524: 2.4.8.1 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.3
	+ Detected and fixed a borderline situation in which the `IPartCostModifier` from the TweakScale's `PartModule` was being called **before** the `OnLoad` while merging a craft with scaled cockpit - unsure if the cockpit made any difference, but whatever.
		- I'm shooting first and making questions later - I will left a proper diagnose to be tackled down on the Beta 2.5.
* 2024-0515: 2.4.8.0 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.3
	+  This release **finally** solves some long standing problems caused by Editor when handling `ModulePartVariant` that I only managed to diagnose recently, see issues [#307](https://github.com/TweakScale/TweakScale/issues/307) and [#314](https://github.com/TweakScale/TweakScale/issues/314) *et all* for the full history for this one.
	+  I **hope** that, **finally**, the 2.4.8.x series will put an end point on the legacy branch. I plan to do only minor adjustments (if needed) on the legacy from now on.
		- If I manage to do everything right (this time), the already legendary 2.5 series will be bought into the mainstream Soonâ„¢.
	+ **ATTENTION**: You need to update [KSP-Recall](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/KSP-Recall/releases) to 0.5.0.1 at least.
