This does not means that the part(s) has(have) a TweakScale problem, it(they) can be alright to be scaled. But since TweakScale cannot know for sure, it's a concern.

This usually happens due Third Parties Add'On, a DLC getting into the way or some really botched patches - ending up borking the check and sometimes breaking something else.

Please report, we are working hard to fix these problems.";
